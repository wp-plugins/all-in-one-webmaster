This is very simple plugin with out any complicated code. It adds your requested meta tags into header and java script code to footer of your blog. You are most welcome to advise on any improvement or bug. I created this plugin as of my personal interest only.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where to find Google, Bing, Yahoo webmaster META tag? =
* Visit links provided in `Settings -> All in One Webmaster` to get your META tag. This is an easiest way to authenticate your sites.

= Google Analytics Account ID =
* Find an Account ID, starting with UA- in your Google Analytics's Account overview page.

= I have updated all my options but why am I not able to authenticate to site or don't see analytics? =
* I assume that `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` are there in your theme. According to the WordPress documentation both functions are theme-dependent which means that it is up to the author of each WordPress theme to include it. If one of the hooks is not in your theme, you could add it yourself by adding `<? php wp_head(); ?>` to your header.php file of your theme or `<? php wp_footer(); ?>` to footer.php.
