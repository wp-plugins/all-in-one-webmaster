== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I upgrade to PRO version? =
* Please visit http://wpplugins.com/plugin/167/all-in-one-webmaster-pro to get PRO version.

= Where to find Google, Bing, Yahoo webmaster META tag? =
* Visit links provided in `Settings -> All in One Webmaster` to get your META tag. This is an easiest way to authenticate your sites.

= Google Analytics Account ID =
* Find an Account ID, starting with UA- in your Google Analytics's Account overview page.

= I have updated all my options but why am I not able to authenticate to site or don't see analytics? =
* I assume that `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` are there in your theme. According to the WordPress documentation both functions are theme-dependent which means that it is up to the author of each WordPress theme to include it. If one of the hooks is not in your theme, you could add it yourself by adding `<? php wp_head(); ?>` to your header.php file of your theme or `<? php wp_footer(); ?>` to footer.php. 

* If you still have problem then try to clear your browser cache, update Admin Panel option and retry.

= How can I add more service meta tags which are not listed here? =
* No worries. You can add those service's HTML code into text area provided in admin panel. 

= Still have a question? =
* Please report all you bug on Plugin Homepage.
